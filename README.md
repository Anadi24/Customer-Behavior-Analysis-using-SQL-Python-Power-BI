Business Objective
Analyze customer purchasing behavior to identify key revenue drivers, engagement patterns, and customer preferences, enabling data-driven business decision-making.
This project follows a real-world analytics workflow, moving from data exploration to SQL analysis and finally to executive-level visualization.


1. Dataset Overview
-Records: ~3,900 customer transactions
-Key attributes:
-Customer demographics (age group, gender)
-Purchase behavior (frequency, previous purchases)
-Revenue metrics
-Payment & shipping preferences
-Subscription status


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
-Data cleaning & validation
-Handling missing values
-Distribution analysis of purchase amount & ratings
-Feature understanding for downstream SQL analysis


3. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)
Performed business-driven SQL queries including:
Revenue by category, season, and subscription status
Gender-wise revenue contribution
Purchase frequency and engagement analysis
Payment and shipping preference impact


4. Key Insights
Non-subscribed customers contribute higher overall revenue, indicating upsell opportunities
Clothing and Accessories dominate category revenue
Purchase frequency shows consistent revenue contribution across segments
Seasonal revenue remains relatively stable, with slight peaks
Gender contribution is balanced, suggesting broad product appeal


5. Tools & Technologies
-Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
-SQL: PostgreSQL
-Visualization: Power BI (DAX, interactive dashboards)
-Version Control: Git & GitHub


6. Project Highlights
-End-to-end analytics workflow (EDA → SQL → BI)
-Business-focused analysis rather than tool-centric reporting
-Clean, single-page dashboard designed for decision-makers
-Modular and well-structured repository
